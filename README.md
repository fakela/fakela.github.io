## About

Hi. My name is Joe. I'm a technical writer based in NYC. 

## Purpose
This is a test space. I'm using it to:

- Share my [resume and work experience](https://jwwojak.github.io/site/resume/resume/).
- Host [writing samples](https://jwwojak.github.io/site/samples/samples-intro/) and my [style guide](https://jwwojak.github.io/site/guide/intro/).
- Test and learn more about [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generation tool that powers [my demo site](https://jwwojak.github.io/site/).
