      <description>Context NBN Co was established in 2009 to design, build and operate Australiaâ€™s wholesale broadband access network.
I was part of NBN&amp;rsquo;s Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC) Network Operations team, working with process analysts to support a large capability project across various Network teams.
Opportunity I was asked to unofficially lead a team of technical writers working on a large documentation project creating process docs and work instructions. When we started as a group, there were no existing documents or knowledge to support process maps.</description>
