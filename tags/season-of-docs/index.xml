      <description>Summary When Google announced the Season of Docs 2021, I led Redocly&amp;rsquo;s effort on submitting a proposal for our open source projects, Redoc and OpenAPI cli. The proposal was accepted by Google, and we hired two technical writers to work on our products.
I managed the administrative part of the project on behalf of Redocly, and also assisted and mentored technical writers contributing to our open source documentation.
Our project had a successful outcome which I captured in our case study.</description>

      <description>Proposal My proposal for the GeoNetwork project involved providing an experienced Technical Writer&amp;rsquo;s perspective to help amplify the quality and effectiveness of some of the existing writing initiatives within the GeoNetwork project, one of the projects under the umbrella of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo).
Project scope  Review GeoNetwork docs, using existing analysis provided by team: https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Season_of_Docs_Ideas_2019#GeoNetwork Create best-practice templates that writing volunteers can use as a basis for creating new or standardising existing content.</description>
