      <description>Context Write the Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation. We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.
Contribution While we have had other communities in Australia that covered technical documentation sporadically, there was no community for like minded people to get together and talk about documentation issues.</description>
