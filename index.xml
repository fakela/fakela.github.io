      <title>Making content sustainable</title>

      <guid>https://fakela.github.io/publications/makedocssustainable/</guid>
      <description>In this talk, I question how to make our content sustainable, especially now when our content is growing at an unprecedented rate. Just when we thought we had a handle on user needs, that seems to be changing every minute. What does it really mean to create sustainable content and how do we achieve this?
 Docs and processes are a mess, but they don’t have to be. Reuse. Reduce. Recycle.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s the deal with Release notes?</title>

      <description>Product managers swear by them, development managers are keen on producing them and quite so often your developers or engineers will help (grudgingly) craft them.
Release notes are everywhere, be it a product or a process. They are quite often your first point of communication with customers eager to know what’s new or fixed in your product or process. In some instances, they also become the most frequently or commonly accessed content on your documentation site.</description>

      <title>When bad screenshots happen to good writers</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;You have your content moving at a swift pace, your documents are getting reviewed in a timely fashion (surprise!) and you are nicely heading towards your release milestone.
The only thing missing are some key screenshots that you need to put in before you publish your documentation. What you get instead are some hideous images posing as screenshots, that were captured randomly, bears no resemblance to your instructions and would make no sense whatsoever to the end user.</description>

      <description>Summary When Google announced the Season of Docs 2021, I led Redocly&amp;rsquo;s effort on submitting a proposal for our open source projects, Redoc and OpenAPI cli. The proposal was accepted by Google, and we hired two technical writers to work on our products.
I managed the administrative part of the project on behalf of Redocly, and also assisted and mentored technical writers contributing to our open source documentation.
Our project had a successful outcome which I captured in our case study.</description>

      <description>Context Write the Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation. We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.
Contribution While we have had other communities in Australia that covered technical documentation sporadically, there was no community for like minded people to get together and talk about documentation issues.</description>

Opportunity I was asked to unofficially lead a team of technical writers working on a large documentation project creating process docs and work instructions. When we started as a group, there were no existing documents or knowledge to support process maps.</description>

      <description>I was invited by Madcap Software to write a guest post for their blog. I wrote about a case study where I had to justify the use of single sourcing at the organisation I was working at the time.
To summarise how the single sourcing strategy worked at the organisation was:
 Avoided issues with duplication of content. All my content resided in one location, reducing inconsistencies. Set a consistent look and feel across all the documentation projects.</description>
