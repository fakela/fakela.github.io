                            <h2>My journey as a web developer</h2>
            <p>When I started working as a front end web devloper in 2018, I spent most of my time crafting HTML/CSS layouts from online learning using codecademy and w3schools.My role began to shift the day i had a talk with samson goddy.With his recommendation to demand responsibility whether you work for a boss or a client,Samson gave me the push i needed.  </p>
            <p>I wasnt expecting to make any big leaps yet-just enough to feel like i was headed in the right direction</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>In the ensuing years, as a front-end developer was a bit interesting and challenging, developing skills began to evolve, leading to more frustration.Although i'm proud to believe i'm part of the group that evolved with the role.I hope sharing this will help encourage others has passion in front end web development.</p>
            <p>As my career has started evolving, i find faraway from   i love the most and started enjoying team work more.At first i was amazed at how  the whole they where approaching the process, the whole team has a strong techincal background, unlike any team i have ever worked with, which makes collaboration very efficient.infact,during my first few weeks i was constantly pushed out of my comfort zone and my skills were challenged to the fullest. i soon found my next challenge to build stronger connection with the design and the develpment teams</p>
