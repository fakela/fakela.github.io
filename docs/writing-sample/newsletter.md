### Project: Bacalhau Updates - February 2023

**Description:** Crafted a compelling monthly newsletter for Bacalhau, a cutting-edge technology platform, to provide highlights of their latest release, upcoming events, exciting updates, and more.

**Role:** Technical Writer

**Approach:** My approach to this newsletter was to blend technical depth with reader-friendly language. I aimed to ensure that even non-technical readers could grasp the valuable insights presented about Bacalhau's developments.
