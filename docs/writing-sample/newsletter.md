# Welcome to my Newsletter Writing Portfolio

Welcome to my Newsletter Writing portfolio section! As a technical writer with a knack for effective communication, I specialize in crafting engaging and informative newsletters that captivate your audience. Below is an example of my work in this category:

### Project: Newsletter Bacalhau Updates

**Description:** Crafted a compelling monthly newsletter for Bacalhau, a cutting-edge technology platform, to provide highlights of their latest release, upcoming events, exciting updates, and more.

**Role:** Technical Writer

**Approach:** My approach to this newsletter was to blend technical depth with reader-friendly language. I aimed to ensure that even non-technical readers could grasp the valuable insights presented about Bacalhau's developments.

Here is the list of newsletter I have written for Bacalhau
