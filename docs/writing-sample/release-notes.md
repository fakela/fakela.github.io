# Welcome to my Release Note Writing Portfolio Section

As a dedicated technical writer, I excel in creating meticulous and informative release notes that serve as essential communication tools between your product development team and your valued users. 

### Project: Mindee Invoice OCR release notes

**Description:** Crafted comprehensive release notes to accompany the launch of WidgetPro Version 2.0, a significant update to our versatile widget creation tool.

**Tools Used:** Readme.io

**Approach:** My approach was to provide a clear, concise summary of the new features, enhancements, and bug fixes in Mindee. I focused on making the release notes easily understandable for users of all technical levels, ensuring they can grasp the value and implications of the new update at a glance.
