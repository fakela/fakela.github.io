# Troubleshooting and FAQ Writing Portfolio Sample

Welcome to my Troubleshooting and FAQ Writing portfolio section! As a technical writer, I excel in creating comprehensive troubleshooting guides and FAQ documents that provide users with clear solutions to common issues. Below is an example of my work in this category:

### Project: Bacalhau FAQs

**Description:** Detailed troubleshooting and frequently asked questions (FAQ) documentation for Bacalhau, a versatile computing platform, to assist users in resolving common problems and queries.

**Tools Used:** Docusaurus, Markdown

**Approach:** My approach in developing this guide was to first identify the most common challenges and questions users face while interacting with Bacalhau. I then structured the information in a clear, easy-to-navigate format, making sure to provide straightforward, actionable solutions. My focus was on clarity and accessibility, ensuring that both new and experienced users could find the help they need without unnecessary complexity.
