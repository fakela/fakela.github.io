# API Documentation

Welcome to the API Documentation section of my portfolio! As a dedicated technical writer, I excel in creating clear, detailed, and user-friendly API documentation that facilitates seamless integration and interaction with software systems. Below, you'll find a sample of my work in this realm:

### Project: Mindee REST API Guide

**Description:** Crafted a comprehensive API documentation guide for the Mindee REST API, enabling developers to effectively utilize its powerful document parsing capabilities. The documentation covers various aspects, including authentication, document inputs, working with images and PDFs, making API calls, handling predictions, error management, and technical limitations.

**Role:** Technical Writer

**Tools Used:** Markdown

**Approach:** Collaborated closely with Mindee's development team to gain in-depth insights into the REST API's functionalities and intended use cases. The documentation emphasizes clarity, practical examples, and adherence to best practices for API integration.
