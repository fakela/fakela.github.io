# Reference Documentation

Reference documentation explains, lists, and describes or defines features like buttons, menu options, code, dataset fields, API functions, and [architectural decision records](https://adr.github.io/) (ADRs). You write reference documents to help your users better understand the details of individual components of a product or system.

## Features

Common features of a reference document include:

- Descriptive titles that suggest or summarize the main topics.

- A multi-column table that lists terms and their corresponding definitions. A basic, 2-column term and definition layout is sufficient.

## Style advice

Keep your reference docs simple. Written content should consist mainly of a term and its related definition. Tables are great for reference material.

When defining dataset fields, file names, or code, use formatting that gives each term a `code-like` appearance and use plain text definitions. If you're not writing about code, just use plain text.

## What to avoid

Long-form conceptual content or task topics don't belong in a reference document. Link to those documents rather than stuffing unrelated information in a reference document.

Try to keep table columns to a minimum. If you need more than 3 or 4 columns, think about combining that content or using another layout.
