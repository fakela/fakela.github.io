# Concept Documentation

Concept documentation explains and describes. For example, you might write a concept piece to explain an idea at a high level or describe why your team created a particular system. Conceptual content can also include detailed information or a strategic analysis of a product or service. Write concept docs to tell readers why you created something rather than how to use it.

## Features

Common features of concept documentation include:

- Descriptive titles that suggest or summarize the main topics.

- Sections of related content separated by informative headers.

- Notes, tips, warnings, and other call-outs that focus attention on important items.
- Numbered or bulleted lists that do not enumerate procedures or task steps.
- Tables
- Images and diagrams
- Code samples

## Style advice

Write concept documentation in the present tense and use the [active voice](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/conversational/use-active-voice/). This style is ideal for expressing facts and helps make writing authoritative. Content that is accurate and frank builds user trust in your documentation and products.

Additionally, present-tense writing imparts a “timeless” quality to your documentation. Timelessness is important because you don’t want documentation to read as stale or dated as time passes. For example, even if the code underlying a system changes, the purpose of a system may remain the same. With the present tense, your content remains valid and accurate even after you refactor code. Save yourself from future work. Write in the present tense.

## What to avoid

Conceptual documentation shouldn't contain tasks, procedural steps, or reference information. Task and reference content are separate topic types. Documentation for these topics follow a different set of standards.
