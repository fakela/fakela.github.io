# Italic Text

## Common use - Emphasis

Format text with _italics_ when you want to place stress, emphasis, or importance on a word or phrase. _Do not_ use [bold text](style_bold.md) for emphasis.

!!! tip "Call-outs"
    If you think some text needs special attention, put that information in a call-out. Call-outs are text items like a "Tip", "Warning", "Note", or "Info" box. See the [Admonition extensions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#supported-types) for a list of supported call-out  types in MkDocs.

## Other uses

### Unique words, terms, or phrases

When you introduce a unique word or phrase, consider putting that text in italics on first mention and use plain text thereafter. This is optional. Here are some examples:

- **Acceptable:** A _Unique User ID_  . . .
- **Acceptable:** A Unique User ID . . .
- **Avoid:**  A **Unique User ID** . . .

### As a placeholder

You can put text in italics as a placeholder or temporary text for content that has not been written yet or as a variable. For example:

"To implement this process, see _documentation TBD_."

### Foreign language phrases

You can use italics as a style indicator for brief foreign language phrases, particularly Latin (e.g., _id est_, _exempli grata_, _inter alia_). You don't need to do this with abbreviations.

## Standards for reference

These rules are based upon the [ DITA standards for technical writing](https://www.xml.com/articles/2017/01/19/what-dita/). This is a set of rules for documentation types, content, and a XML library for tagging text. The DITA framework uses italics for text that is important or needs emphasis. See the [DITA specification for italics](https://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.0/langspec/i.html):

>Italic highlighting generally means a font that is slanted for emphasis, but this may vary depending on your output formatting process.
