# Introduction

This section provides recommendations on how to write and style specific page and text elements. These recommendations are based on our experience of working with engineering teams on documentation. This advice tries to address issues that appear often in draft, work-in-progress content.

Your Friends at the _Guide_&trade; believe these guidelines help promote good writing. However, like the pirate code, sometimes rules are rules and sometimes they’re just suggestions. Occasionally, you might need to bend or break them. That’s OK too. Whatever you decide to do, just be consistent in doing it.
