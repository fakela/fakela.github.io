# Section Outline

Here’s a blueprint to follow when you’re not sure about how to organize your documentation space or what kind of sections you should include. These are recommendations, not rules or requirements. If you have a good docs structure that works, keep it. If you're not sure what to do try using the simple outline shown here.

## Section Outline

The outline below provides a suggested table of contents (TOC) for a documentation space. Each main section can be a standalone parent page or a parent object that contains child pages.

I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homepage/landing page<br>
II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview<br>
III.&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Started<br>
IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other content<br>
V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAQs<br>
VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;ADRs

??? tip "MkDocs and the TOC"
    We're using MkDocs to build and organize the space and content you're reading now. For anyone using MkDocs, you edit the `mkdocs.yml` file to add, delete, and reorganize the content hierarchy in your documentation space. <font color="red">LINK TBD</FONT>
