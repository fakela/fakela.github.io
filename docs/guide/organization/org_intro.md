# Introduction

This section of the writing guide is designed to help engineering teams organize new documentation or revise the structure of an existing content repo. Here our guide:

- Suggests an ideal organizational hierarchy for each of the main sections in your documentation.

- Lists and describes the purpose of each main section in a well-ordered documentation space.

- Outlines the sections and content _within_ important individual pages in your documentation.

You may have other ideas about how to organize documentation. If thatâ€™s the case, fantastic! We encourage you to act on those thoughts and go for it. Let that passion and vision come out in your content organization and writing. However, we still encourage you to review this guide. Something here may help refine or improve the structure of your documentation.

## Next steps

Here are some recommendations:

- Start with the [Section Outline](org_outline.md). It provides and organizational blueprint for main sections of a documentation space.

- Next, review [Homepage Theory and Purpose](home_outline.md). It discusses the importance of a good homepage and guides you to other documents that show you how to create an effective and helpful homepage.

- Finally, just browse sections that seem interesting or relevant to the documentation issues you or your team are struggling with.
