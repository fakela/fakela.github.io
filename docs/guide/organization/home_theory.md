# Homepage Theory and Purpose

The homepage is the main entry point for your documentation space. But it's more than just another page of documentation. In fact, the homepage is so essential that we've devoted an entire section of this guide to it. If you’re stuck and aren’t sure what to do, perhaps this information can get you started with a basic homepage. After reading this, we hope you learn:

- What type of content to include on your homepage.
- How to organize your homepage.
- How to format your homepage.

You should feel free to modify this design as you become more comfortable with writing or to suit your documentation needs. 

## Theory and purpose

It might help you to think of the homepage for your docs as a space similar to the waiting area in an airport or train station. These places are filled with people passing through quickly on their way to a particular destination. As a result, the information displayed in lobby areas should be brief but informative.

Like a physical lobby area, your documentation homepage is also a transitional space. But, instead of flying off to a business or holiday destination, a homepage guides readers to specific pages or sections in your documentation. Your homepage isn’t the destination itself. It is a page that helps readers get to their real destination, i.e., the information they need to understand a service or to complete a task. As a result, you should try to create a documentation homepage that scores a few important goals for your readers.

## Goals

A good documentation homepage:
    
- Summarizes your system, app, or service in a concise paragraph. If you need more room to write, create and link to a separate "Overview" section or page from the homepage.

- Recommends and links to sections of your documentation or to individual articles. Be opinionated. Tell your readers if you think something is important to know because it probably is!
    
- Identifies communication channels. Tell readers who owns/manages your docs, where to ask questions or report errors, and (optionally) how to help make contributions or get involved.

## Next steps

Enough theory! Let’s try to put these ideas into practice by creating an outline that meets the minimum goals we've set for a documentation homepage. See the [Homepage Outline and Section Summaries](home_outline.md) next.
