- **Identity**: When you first mention the name your team or squad, link that text to your team's space, page, or any other resource that explains who you are and what you do.

- **Stack Overflow**: If you encourage readers to ask questions in Stack Overflow, provide some descriptive text that links to Stack and includes code that auto-populates the tag field (e.g. `https://company_name.stackenterprise.co/questions/ask?tags=<insert tag here>`).
