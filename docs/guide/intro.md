_There are three rules for writing . . . Unfortunately, no one knows what they are._

## Hello world

Welcome to the _Technical Writing Guide_. The _Guide_ is for engineers and developers who need to write technical documentation but aren’t sure how to begin. Our documentation philosophy treats content like code and keeps content with the code. In practice, this means writing in a simple language like Markdown and working in familiar development environments (e.g., with Visual Studio and GitHub). The goal of this guide is to help you write documentation that’s confident, clear, accurate, and authoritative.

## Why write documentation

Writing good documentation is essential. It helps everyone in your organization understand and use the services and systems that you create. But, sometimes writing is a difficult, intimidating, and tedious activity. Maybe you're unsure about what to include, exclude, or how to organize written content. As a result, we've created this guide. It can help you understand how to write, organize content, and resolve common technical writing issues.

??? info "Secondary goals"
    This work is a writing sample and reflects my thoughts about how to create and organize technical documentation. It's a writing reference that's grown over the years. I've used it, in one form or another, at all the companies I've worked for. If you're an experienced technical writer, this information is not that new. Instead, this information is for less experienced content creators (e.g., engineers and developers) who need to write documentation for the systems, services, and products that they build.

## Next steps

Here are suggestions about where to go next:

- [Topic-Based Writing and Documentation Types](types/types_intro.md): An introduction and short primer on organizing complex technical subjects into topics and specific document topic types.

- [Organizing Sections and Pages](organization/org_intro.md): An outline and description of how to organize the table of contents and individual sections in your documentation space.
