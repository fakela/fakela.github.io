# API Documentation

Welcome to the API Documentation section of my portfolio! As a dedicated technical writer, I excel in creating clear, detailed, and user-friendly API documentation that facilitates seamless integration and interaction with software systems. Below, you'll find a sample of my work in this realm:

### Project: Mindee REST API Guide

**Description:** Crafted a comprehensive API documentation guide for the Mindee REST API, enabling developers to effectively utilize its powerful document parsing capabilities. The documentation covers various aspects, including authentication, document inputs, working with images and PDFs, making API calls, handling predictions, error management, and technical limitations.

**Role:** Lead API Technical Writer

**Tools Used:** Markdown

**Approach:** Collaborated closely with Mindee's development team to gain in-depth insights into the REST API's functionalities and intended use cases. The documentation emphasizes clarity, practical examples, and adherence to best practices for API integration.

**Key Sections:**

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Provided a comprehensive guide to authenticating API requests using API Keys, with an emphasis on security practices.
   - Highlighted the importance of keeping API keys confidential and avoiding exposure.

2. **Document Inputs:**
   - Introduced the concept of documents within Mindee, including supported file types such as images (JPG, PNG, WEBP, TIFF, HEIC) and PDFs.
   - Detailed payload formats for sending documents, including binary files, base64 encoding, and public URLs.

3. **Working with Images:**
   - Covered optimal practices for working with images, including supported file formats and tips for better processing.
   - Emphasized the advantages of images over PDFs for faster processing.

4. **Working with PDFs:**
   - Explained how to work with multi-page PDF files, including usage of native PDFs and the use of the `cutPdf` option.
   - Provided tips for effective processing and handling of PDF documents.

5. **API Calls and Endpoints:**
   - Described the various Mindee REST API endpoints, including the Predictions Endpoint, with detailed URL patterns and base URL structure.

6. **Authentication in API Calls:**
   - Illustrated how to include API keys in API requests using custom HTTP Authorization headers.
   - Addressed scenarios for off-the-shelf APIs and custom APIs.

7. **JSON Response and Predictions:**
   - Explained the structure of JSON responses, including the `api_request` object and the `document` object containing predictions.
   - Provided examples of prediction objects with various fields and values.

8. **Error Management:**
   - Detailed Mindee's REST API status and error codes, with explanations of common error scenarios and their corresponding HTTP status codes.

9. **Technical Limitations:**
   - Outlined the rate limits, payload constraints, and data model limitations enforced within the Mindee REST API.
   - Offered guidance on optimizing API usage and staying within the specified limits.

**Tools Used:** Markdown

This API documentation equips developers with the knowledge and guidance to seamlessly integrate the Mindee REST API into their applications, leveraging its advanced document parsing capabilities.
