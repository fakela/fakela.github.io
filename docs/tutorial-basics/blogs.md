# Blogs and Articles Writing Sample

Welcome to my Blogs and Articles writing sample section! As a proficient writer, I enjoy creating engaging and informative blog posts and articles on a wide range of topics. Below are some examples of my work in this domain:

### Article: "How to Evaluate and Load a PyTorch Model with Giskard"

**Description:** This article takes you through the process of uploading a PyTorch model to Giskard, a tool designed to identify potential errors and biases. It addresses the challenges of training and testing PyTorch models and demonstrates how Giskard can help ensure model quality.

**Platform:** Personal Blog

**Key Points:**

- Explores the common challenges faced when training PyTorch models and the importance of model evaluation.
- Introduces Giskard as a tool for testing and analyzing PyTorch models for biases, robustness, and discriminative behavior.
- Provides step-by-step instructions for building a PyTorch model, wrapping it with Giskard, and analyzing it for potential issues.
- Demonstrates how Giskard's UI can be used to debug tests, compare models, and collaborate on model analysis.
- Includes a guide for uploading pre-trained models, specifically the XLM-ROBERTA model, for fine-tuning and further analysis.

This article showcases my ability to explain complex concepts clearly and guide readers through practical implementations.
