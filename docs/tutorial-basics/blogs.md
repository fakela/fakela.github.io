# Blogs and Articles Writing Sample

Welcome to my Blogs and Articles writing sample section! As a proficient writer, I enjoy creating engaging and informative blog posts and articles on a wide range of topics. Below are some examples of my work in this domain:

### Article: "How to Evaluate and Load a PyTorch Model with Giskard"

**Description:** This article takes you through the process of uploading a PyTorch model to Giskard, a tool designed to identify potential errors and biases. It addresses the challenges of training and testing PyTorch models and demonstrates how Giskard can help ensure model quality.

**Platform:** Personal Blog

**Key Points:**

- Explores the common challenges faced when training PyTorch models and the importance of model evaluation.
- Introduces Giskard as a tool for testing and analyzing PyTorch models for biases, robustness, and discriminative behavior.
- Provides step-by-step instructions for building a PyTorch model, wrapping it with Giskard, and analyzing it for potential issues.
- Demonstrates how Giskard's UI can be used to debug tests, compare models, and collaborate on model analysis.
- Includes a guide for uploading pre-trained models, specifically the XLM-ROBERTA model, for fine-tuning and further analysis.

This article showcases my ability to explain complex concepts clearly and guide readers through practical implementations. If you're interested in exploring more articles or have specific topics in mind, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:favourkelvin17@gmail.com). I'm enthusiastic about contributing to your content needs!
