# Introduction

This section provides examples of my technical writing. I wrote this documentation for product knowledge base repositories, internal engineering teams, and customer-facing or account management teams. The pages in each section are related, but they’re not the full documentation for a product or service. The information in these articles describes real systems or processes that may or may not be in operation today. 

Also, I’ve created all the illustrations and diagrams in these examples. As a technical writer, I’ve had little graphic design support and had to make images on my own. I’ve used tools like Visio, Adobe Illustrator, Google Drawings, and Lucid Chart to add images to my written work.
