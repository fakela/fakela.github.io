The only way they could find this out was by contacting technical support.\nIt was essential to let customers know frequently what we were working on and how it would enhance their developer experience.\nContribution I took it upon myself to start writing a monthly marketing blog post that captured everything that was been delivered as part of our products, and also promote this through our social media channels - Twitter and Linkedin.\nI worked with our developers, testers, and the management team to keep track of new features, enhancements and tweaks across our products and converted this into marketing blog posts every month.\nOver the course of the last 14 months, I published:\n 11 monthly blog posts that captured product, docs and company news from the immediate previous month, 2 yearly blog posts that captured the best of our product features, documentation and project updates over the preceding 11 months.
